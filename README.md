# UFOs

## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this project is to create a dynamic webpage with a table that shows the UFO sightings data with multiple filtering capabilities. 

The original webpage only provided a date filter and to provide better visualization for the users, additional filters were created such as City, State, Country, and Shape.

## Results
The first webpage only had a date filter and the users needed to click a button for the filter to be applied. 

The new webpage allows users to filter date, city, state, country and shape. And the filter us applied by inputting a criteria into one of the filter fields. The webpage will then automatically filter the table to display relevant data. 

Below is how the webpage looks like before applying a filter:

This is an example of the webpage after filtering for city "el cajon":

## Summary of Analysis
One drawback of this webpage is that the table is currently unable to resize based on the device which the webpage is viewed on. 

One recommendation for further development is to add a feature for the webpage to be able to readjust its formatting based on the device that it's being used. 

Another recommendation is to connect the webpage via API to a UFO database to get updated information on UFO sightings, so the data won't be limited to 2010.
